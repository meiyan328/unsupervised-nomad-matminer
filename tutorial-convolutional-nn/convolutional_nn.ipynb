A pooling function replaces the output of the network at a certain location with a summary statistic of the nearby outputs. For example, the max pooling operation reports the maximum output within a rectangular neighborhood. Other popular pooling functions include the average of a rectangular neighborhood, the $L^2$ norm of a rectangular neighborhood, or a weighted average based on the distance from the central pixel.\n",

    "### 2. Motivation\n",
    "Why one should use convolutional neural networks instead of simple (fully connected) neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution leverages three important ideas that can help improve a machine learning system: \n",
    "- **sparse interactions**\n",
    "- **parameter sharing**\n",
    "- **equivariant representations**   \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, convolution provides a means for working with inputs of variable size - while this is not possible with fully connected neural networks (also called multi-layer perceptrons).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Sparse interactions\n",
    "##### Fully connected NN\n",
    "It uses matrix multiplication by a matrix of parameters with a separate parameter describing the interaction between each input unit and each output unit. This means that every output unit interacts with every input unit. This do not scale well to full images. For example, an image of 200x200x3 would lead to neurons that have 200x200x3 = 120,000 weights. Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons. Clearly, this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.\n",
    "##### CNN\n",
    "It achieves sparse interactions (sparse connectivity) by making the kernel smaller than the input. When processing an image, we can detect small, meaningful features such as edges with kernels that occupy only tens or hundreds of pixels. (*see Sec. 3.3.2 for two concrete examples*).   \n",
    "This means that we need to store fewer parameters, which both reduces the memory requirements of the model and improves its statistical efficiency. It also means that computing the output requires fewer operations. If there are $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs, then matrix multiplication requires $m \\times n$ parameters, and the algorithms used in practice have $O(m \\times n)$ runtime (per example). If we limit the number of connections each output may have to $k$, then the sparsely connected approach requires only $k \\times n$ parameters and $O(k \\times n)$ runtime. For many practical applications, $k$ is several orders of magnitude smaller than $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Parameter sharing\n",
    "It refers to using the same parameter for more than one function in a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fully connected NN\n",
    "Each element of the weight matrix is used exactly once when computing the output of a layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### CNN\n",
    "Each member of the kernel is used at every position of the input. The parameter sharing used by the convolution operation means that rather than learning a separate set of parameters for every location, we learn only one set. This further reduce the storage requirements of the model to $k$ parameters. Recall that $k$ is usually several orders of magnitude smaller than $m$. Since $m$ and $n$ are usually roughly the same size, $k$ is practically insignificant compared to $m \\times n$. Convolution is thus dramatically more efficient than dense matrix multiplication in terms of the memory requirements and statistical efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Equivariant representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter sharing causes the layer to have **equivariance to translation**. To say a function is equivariant means that if the input changes, the output changes in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing time-series data, this means that convolution produces a sort of timeline that shows when different features appear in the input. If we move an event later in time in the input, the exact same representation of it will appear in the output, just later. Similarly with images, convolution creates a 2-D map of where certain features appear in the input. If we move the object in the input, its representation will move the same amount in the output. This is useful for when we know that some function of a small number of neighboring pixels is useful when applied to multiple input locations."

    "## 3. The convolution operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Summary and intuition\n",
    "The convolutional layer's parameters consist of a set of learnable filters. Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. For example, a typical filter on a first layer of a ConvNet might have size 5x5x3 (i.e. 5 pixels width and height, and 3 because images have depth 3, the color channels). \n",
    "\n",
    "* During the forward pass, we slide (more precisely, convolve) each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. Intuitively, a convolution can be thought as a sliding (weighted) average.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. Intuitively, the network will learn filters that activate when they see some type of visual feature such as an edge of some orientation or a blotch of some color on the first layer, or eventually entire honeycomb or wheel-like patterns on higher layers of the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "* At this stage, we have an entire set of filters in each convolutional layer (e.g. 12 filters), and each of them produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We stack these activation maps along the depth dimension and produce the output volume.\n",

    "### 3.2 Mathematical formulation - from Ref. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main idea\n",
    "Suppose we are tracking the location of a spaceship with a laser sensor. Our laser sensor provides a single output $x(t)$, the position of the spaceship at time $t$. Now suppose that our laser sensor is somewhat noisy. To obtain a less noisy estimate of the spaceship’s position, we would like to average several measurements. Of course, more recent measurements are more relevant, so we will want this to be a weighted average that gives more weight to recent measurements. We can do this with a weighting function $w(a)$, where $a$ is the age of a measurement.    \n",
    "If we apply such a weighted average operation at every moment, we obtain a new function $s$ providing a smoothed estimate of the position of the spaceship:    \n",
    "\n",
    "$s(t) = \\int x(a)w(t− a)da$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is called **convolution**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operation is typically denoted with an asterisk:    \n",
    "\n",
    "$s(t) = ( x ∗ w )( t )$\n",
    "\n",
    "In convolutional network terminology, the first argument (in this example, the function $x$) to the convolution is often referred to as the **input**, and the second argument (in this example, the function $w$) as the **kernel**. The output is sometimes referred to as the **feature map**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete version - 1D [optional]\n",
    "Let us assume that time index $t$ can then take on only integer values. If we now assume that $x$ and $w$ are defined only on integer $t$, we can define the discrete convolution:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$s(t) = ( x ∗ w )( t ) = \\sum_{a=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} x(a)w(t− a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete version - 2D [optional]\n",
    "$S(i,j) = (I ∗ k)(i,j) = \\sum_{m}\\sum_{n} I(m,n)K(i-m,j-n)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is commutative, so we can write:    \n",
    "\n",
    "$S(i,j) = (K ∗ I)(i,j) = \\sum_{m}\\sum_{n} I(i-m,j-n)K(m,n)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the latter formula is more straightforward to implement in a machine learning library, because there is less variation in the range of valid values of $m$ and $n$. The commutative property of convolution arises because we have flipped the kernel relative to the input, in the sense that as $m$ increases, the index into the input increases, but the index into the kernel decreases. The only reason to flip the kernel is to obtain the commutative property. While the commutative property is useful for writing proofs, it is not usually an important property of a neural network implementation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, many neural network libraries implement a related function called the cross-correlation, which is the same as convolution but without flipping the kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$S(i,j) = (I ∗ K)(i,j) = \\sum_{m}\\sum_{n} I(i+m,j+n)K(m,n)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning libraries implement cross-correlation but call it *convolution*. In the context of machine learning, the learning algorithm will learn the appropriate values of the kernel in the appropriate place, so an algorithm based on convolution with kernel flipping will learn a kernel that is flipped relative to the kernel learned by an algorithm without the flipping.
